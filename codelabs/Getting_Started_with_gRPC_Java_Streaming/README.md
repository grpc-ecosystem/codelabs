# Getting Started with gRPC-Java Streaming

Get hands-on with gRPC for Java in this interactive codelab! <!-- TODO(larry-safran): Insert link once codelab is published. -->

This is a follow on to Getting Started with gRPC which has a unary RPC.

Perfect for Java developers new to gRPC, those seeking a refresher, or anyone building distributed systems. No prior gRPC experience needed! 

#### Build a complete gRPC service from scratch, learning: 
- Protocol Buffers (protobuf): Define service contracts & data. 
- gRPC Code Generation: Auto-generate Java code. 
- Client/Server Communication: Implement seamless interactions. 
- Client Streaming, Server Streaming and Bidi Streaming.

#### You'll gain: 
- A working gRPC service in Java. 
- Hands-on experience with Protocol Buffers and code generation. 
- Skills to design, build, & test gRPC clients and servers. 
- A strong foundation in gRPC for real-world projects.

## How to use this directory

- [start_here](start_here/) directory serves as a starting point for the
codelab. 
- [complete](complete/) directory showcases the finished code, giving you a peak
of how the final implementation should look like.
